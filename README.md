### Bun is not displaying complete error messages

When running "next dev" using bun runtime, the specific error messages aren't available and the error you get is "Error: An unexpected Turbopack error occurred. Please see the output of `next dev` for more details."
When running next dev using node, the error messages are displayed correctly.
